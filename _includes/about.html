        I am an enthusiastic software developer who enjoys learning different technologies. I am a quick learner, and I love the feeling of conquering new technology. Different to other programmers, I have humanity background, and that makes me an more understanding person who is good at discerning people’s needs. 

I like to describe myself as an “adventurous introvert”. I look shy but actually is bold and ambitious in mind. When out of work, I like to draw and do graphic. When there is a long vacation, I like to travel as a backpacker, experiencing different lives around the world. 

If you are interested in letting an “adventurous introverted front-end developer” to join your team, please contact me. Thank you very much.
