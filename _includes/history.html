        <p>After finishing my bachelor's degree, I had been taking internship as an English teacher in 
          a middle school for half a year. During the internship, I learned some basic web developing skills
          from a teacher who made website for the school, and I found it really interesting. To me, I have more
          passion in programming than teaching, so I decieded to become a programmer rather than a teacher.
