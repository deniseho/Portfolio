      NewsSmith is brand-new news editing system for United Daily News. We built this system with 
      ASP.NET MVC framework. 
      Compare to the previous system, NewsSmith is praised for its better UI design and stability. 
      In this project, I participated in the dicussion of UI design, and I tesed the system when it came out updated codes or new versions. 
      I found out many bugs that were not easy to diagnose, and I also gave lots of suggestions to improve user experience. On the other hand, I wrote a tutorial webpage for the system, which made me more familiar with MVC structure.
